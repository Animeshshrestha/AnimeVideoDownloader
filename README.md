This project for now only scrapes the episode from the anime name you have entered  To run the scrapy go to inside gogoanime directory and run command:  
`scrapy crawl gogoanime -o episodes.json`  
And for rest just run python sample.py withh choices you are provided. 

P.S. On the produc phase so no testing or code for wrong prompt has been used . :)
